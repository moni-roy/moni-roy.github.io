            <p>
              I am working as a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Bangladesh
              Institute (SRBD). I completed my MS & BS degree from the
              Department of CSE, Jahangirnagar University which is the only
              fully residential university and the most beautiful campus in our
              country.

              I worked as a Technical Assistant (TA) at Dept. of CSE, JU for six
              months and also trained students to solve problems efficiently
              using algorithms & data structures for three years. It was a
              great, exciting and challenging experience for me. I always enjoy
              and love to solve various problems using Algorithms & Data
              structures. I am participating in various programming contests
              since 2013.

              Processing, Data Mining, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber
